- "proof of concept G2net" model for the kaggle challenge  (will be available only from saturday 10 december because the model is currently being designed and/or trained)
- "Genhack_challenge_ginger_elephants" is the code my team and I work currently on for the Genhack challenge.
- "RL-HW1-ANDREWS-Roland" is just a homework in RL with nice animations
