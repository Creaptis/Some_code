# For my application at MILA institute 

I have put in this repository a few sample of codes which come from various projects or homework. To spare your time I list them here in decreasing order of importance :


- "Genhack_challenge_ginger_elephants" is the code my team and I work currently on for the Genhack challenge.
- "RL-HW1-ANDREWS-Roland" is just a homework in RL with nice animations
- "Roland_Andrews_TD2_computational_statistics" is just a homework in computational statistics.
